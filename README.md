#Cool Stream, Bro

I was watching PJ's stream, and he had suddenly a lot of problems with Amarec.
I figured I could throw something together quickly that can record audio/video from inputs (and preview it simultaneously).

So I did.

Cool story, bro. 

Cheers,
Kraln

##Roughness

* You'll need the .NET framework 4.5 ( get it here http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=245484 )
* If you try to write to a file where you don't have permission, it will fail in ugly ways (try your documents folder)
* It doesn't have a proper file picker dialog
* It doesn't remember any of your settings
* It probably won't crash? 

Any problems? Hatred? Let me know coolstreambro@kraln.com

## Todo
 * Support A/V Crossbars (Capture Cards with Audio Intermux'd)
 * Support rebroadcasting
